# Bank PDF Transactions to XLS Converter

## Overview

This app is designed to convert your PDF bank transactions, extracted from your bank website, into Excel (`.xls`) files. Currently, the app supports transactions from Axa, Crelan, and Fortis banks.

Additionally, the app extracts transaction details such as the "comment" and "counterparty" and automatically categorizes each transaction based on predefined dictionaries of categories. The categorization can be enriched with GPT for custom categories.

Let's be clear: the code is not polished or optimized. It was developed quickly to address the immediate need of analyzing bank transaction PDF files. While the current functionality meets this need, the code could benefit from refactoring to improve its readability, structure, and overall quality.
